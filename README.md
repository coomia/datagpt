## How It Works

CoomiaAI follows a simple yet powerful process:  

1. **Ask**: Input a natural language question (e.g., "Show me sales by region").  
2. **Analyze**: The platform processes your data securely on your servers.  
3. **Visualize**: Dynamic charts (like bar or line graphs) appear with your results.  
4. **Insight**: Receive clear, actionable takeaways to guide your next steps.

*Imagine a dashboard where you ask, "Which products are underperforming?" and CoomiaAI responds with a chart highlighting trends, plus a note like "Product Z needs a 10% price adjustment to boost sales!"*
